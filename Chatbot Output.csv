Explain the difference between Expected Behavior and Actual Behavior in bug reporting based on the document.,"Expected Behavior refers to the desired or expected outcome or result that should occur when a particular section of code or system is executed. It is what the user or tester expects to happen based on the intended functionality.

Actual Behavior, on the other hand, refers to the actual outcome or result that occurs when the section of code or system is executed. It is what actually happens or is observed during the execution.

In bug reporting, the section where the expected behavior is described explains what the user or tester expects the code or system to do. This helps to provide clarity and context to the bug report.

The section where the actual behavior is described explains what actually happens when the code or system is executed. It provides details about any deviations or defects observed in the deployment or end-state of the system.

By documenting the expected behavior and comparing it to the actual behavior, bug reports can effectively communicate the issue or bug and help developers understand what needs to be fixed or addressed."

1. Screenshots and error messages should be included in bug reports as they provide proof of the observed problem and serve as a starting point for investigating the issue.

2. When taking screenshots, capture the relevant error message or the area where the bug occurs. This will help the development team understand the issue more effectively.

3. In the bug report, describe the expected behavior and compare it to the actual behavior. This will provide context for the bug and aid in understanding the issue.

4. Include step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the bug. This will help the development team replicate the issue and find a solution.

5. If possible, include any relevant log data or system information that may assist in troubleshooting the bug.

6. Prioritize and estimate the bugs based on their impact and severity. Categorize them into high, medium, and low priority to ensure that critical issues are addressed first.

7. Remember that screenshots and error messages alone may not be sufficient to fully understand and resolve a bug. It may require additional investigation and debugging to find the root cause.

3. Note the expected versus actual behavior: In the bug report, there should be a section where the expected behavior of the code or system is described, along with a description of the actual behavior observed.

4. Investigate the issue: Before estimating the bug, it is important to investigate the issue, including looking into the code, debugging, and isolating the problem.

5. Prioritize and estimate the bug: Once the issue has been investigated, the bug should be prioritized and estimated based on its impact and severity. Bugs can be categorized into high priority (affecting core functionality), medium priority (degrading core functionality), and low priority (cosmetic issues).

6. Assign resources and fix the bug: After prioritizing and estimating the bug, resources should be assigned to fix the bug based on its priority. The bug should be fixed within a dedicated time window or refined and estimated in a user story.

7. Follow up and verify the fix: Once the bug has been fixed, it is important to follow up and verify that the fix has resolved the issue.

By following these steps, a high-priority bug can be effectively handled according to the Bug Reporting Directions."
